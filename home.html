	<p>Scholars’ School &#038; College (SS&#038;C), a pioneer English Version Institution, was started its journey with a noble vision of imparting education and moral values among the students in 2001. It is now one of the leading English Version Institutions in Bangladesh. The word ‘SCHOLARS’ signifies a vast meaning and our motto is to teach and guide to make a real scholar. And our scholars are our students who are representing us around the world through their talents.</p>
<p>SS&#038;C has now two individual campuses for boys and one individual campus for girls in Dhanmondi area with about 3500 students, 200 qualified, dedicated and experienced teachers and more than 150 caring staff. We follow the National Curriculum in English Version. We have both School and College section affiliated by Dhaka Education Board and Ministry of Education. </p>
<p>SS&#038;C is such an institution where the students get all kinds of academic and co-curriculum activities to flourish their latent talents. Our teachers always provide their best efforts to make the students to compete with the modern competitive world. Our students are now studying in different reputed institutions in home and aboard like BUET, DMC, DU, IBA, MIST, IUT etc. Every year our students show their best results in PEC, JSE, SSC and HSC examinations while most of them get A+ and many of them obtain board scholarships. </p>
<p>SS&#038;C is not only an institution of academic excellence but also the students have the opportunity to take part in different cultural activities here. Now, we have Debate Club, English language Club, Science Club, Photography Club and so on. We frequently arrange Math Olympiad, Debate Competition, Science Fair and Art Competition time to time. We also observe all National Days with due honor participating our students. </p>
<p>It unfolds the mission of SS&#038;C from its inception. United we might strive the tough goals and break all shackles on the way to improvement and contribution. SS&#038;C sends out some of the brightest students into the world, who carry the flags of the Scholars’ School &#038; College wherever they drive.</p>
<p>I hope that SS&#038;C will continue to enlighten girls and boys to assume leadership roles, become concerned citizens to remove darkness, who will contribute to the world of knowledge and applications.</p>

	<p>Scholars&#8217; School &#038; College (SS&#038;C), the torch bearer in introducing National Curriculum in English Version, was established in 2001 with the aim of providing quality education to each and every student. To realize this goal, students&#8217; basic knowledge of English is made stronger and built up in such a way so that they can easily, rather effectively, cope up and face the challenges of the competitive world. By now it has turned into a leading institution of its kind and has aptly set a trend for many others to follow.</p>
<p>Presently, we have three campuses with more than three thousand and five hundred students and a team of about two hundred qualified, experienced and dedicated teachers. We have the records of cent percent passing and achieving the area based highest scholarships in the board exams.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves in offering a unique educational experience that our dedicated teaching staff have worked rigorously towards creating and we are constantly trying to promote greater student involvement in extra-curricular activities, resulting in multiple skills. In addition to academic prowess. Scholars&#8217; School &#038; College emphasizes the significance of tolerance of different opinions, values, cultures and religions.</p>
<p>We believe that a school should be led by shared beliefs. We are, therefore, very proud of the relationship we have with our guardians and community. Each and every student is closely monitored thereby, quickly extending a family bondage among students, parents and teachers. I also personally maintain an open door policy for all.</p>
<p>In this digital era, to keep pace with the modern world, accounts, admission procedures, notice, preparation of result and students&#8217; progress report have already been digitalized. Our website provides you with the most up to date, relevant and important information so that you are timely informed.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to remember our founders with gratitude for their noble vision and inexorable dedication to set SS&#038;C on a solid foundation. I also appreciate the parents/ guardians for placing their trust and confidence on SS&#038;C to educate and groom up their children and wards.</p>
<p>Any suggestions for the development of the institution will be highly appreciated.</p>
